# Github Search

I took this on knowing that I have not done an actual module in D8 yet. So
please expect to find novice errors.

I wanted to
 - do a template for the search result rows in stead I am just apppending to the
   #markup (horrible)
 - Add pagination to the search result
 - Add API authentication, as it is it will work for 10 requests per minute, but
   of course this should have a config variable
